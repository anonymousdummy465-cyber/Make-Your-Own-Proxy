# Simple Search Proxy (Educational)

This repository contains a minimal Node.js search proxy that forwards search queries through a server so the upstream search engine sees the server's IP instead of the client's.

Important: This revised version does NOT require any npm installs. It uses only Node.js built-in modules. You still need Node.js installed (v14+ recommended), but you do not need to run `npm install`.

Purpose
- Educational example of how a basic proxy can be implemented.

Features
- Proxies DuckDuckGo Lite search results and rewrites links/forms to stay proxied (simple regex-based HTML rewriting).
- Removes `<script>` tags from proxied HTML (basic mitigation).
- Basic in-memory rate limiting and conservative cache headers.
- No external npm dependencies — single-file server (server.js) + public/ UI.

Requirements
- Node.js 14+ (or newer). No npm install needed.

Install & run
1. Place `server.js` in your project root.
2. Put the UI file `index.html` (and any static assets) inside a `public/` directory next to `server.js`.
3. Start the server:
   - node server.js
4. Open http://localhost:3000 and use the search box.

Notes & security
- This is an educational template. Do not expose a public proxy without strong authentication, abuse controls (CAPTCHA, quotas, IP blocklists), logging, and legal review.
- This lightweight HTML rewriting uses regexes and is not as robust as using an HTML parser — it works for many simple pages (like lite.duckduckgo.com) but is not perfect.
- Respect the target site's Terms of Service and robots.txt. Prefer official APIs for automated access.
- For production, add TLS (run behind HTTPS), persistent logging, and stricter rate-limiting.
